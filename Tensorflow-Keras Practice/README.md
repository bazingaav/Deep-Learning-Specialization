## 1. Digit Recognition - MNIST Dataset
* Keras API is used with Tensorflow in backend.
* In Course 2 of this specialization, an introduction to Tensorflow 1.x was given but I tried my hand at Tensorflow 2.0 with this project.
* Sequential models with 2 dense hidden layers with 128 hidden units each were constructed & two different optimizers namely Stocastic Gradient Descent & ADAM were implemented.
* The model with ADAM optimizer gave the best accuracy of 97.68% while the model with SGD optimizer gave almost similar accuracy of 97.36%
* It was a basic experiment with no hyper-parameter tuning. Next time I'll be experimenting by using Batch Normalization, tuning no. of hidden layers, 
no. of nodes in each layer & other hyper-parameters.
